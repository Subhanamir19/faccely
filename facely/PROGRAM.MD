---

## **DAILY EXERCISE SELECTION RULES**

### **Rule 1: Score-Based Prioritization**
For each user's lowest 2-3 scoring areas:
- **Score < 60:** Include 2 primary exercises from that category per session
- **Score 60-75:** Include 1 primary + 1 secondary exercise
- **Score > 75:** Include 1 exercise (maintenance mode)

### **Rule 2: Daily Exercise Composition (5-6 exercises)**
- **2 exercises** targeting user's weakest area
- **1-2 exercises** targeting secondary weak areas
- **1 universal exercise** (rotate: lymphatic drainage, fish face)
- **1 support exercise** (rotate: hyoid stretch, neck lift, sternocleidomastoid stretch)

### **Rule 3: Exercise Frequency Caps**
- **High-intensity exercises** (Jaw resistance, CPS, Upward chewing): Max 4x per week
- **Medium-intensity exercises** (Chin tucks, Hunter eyes, Nose massage): Max 5x per week
- **Low-intensity/recovery exercises** (Lymphatic drainage, Fish face, Sternocleidomastoid stretch): Daily OK

---

## **PROGRESSIVE OVERLOAD FRAMEWORK**

### **Phase 1: Foundation (Days 1-21)**
- Introduction of basic exercises
- Focus on proper form and muscle awareness
- Lower intensity variations of exercises
- Gradual introduction to the full exercise library

### **Phase 2: Development (Days 22-49)**
- Full exercise variations introduced
- Increased difficulty levels where applicable
- More complex multi-target exercises added
- Introduction of resistance-based modifications

### **Phase 3: Peak (Days 50-70)**
- Maximum difficulty variations
- Extended hold durations for static exercises
- Increased resistance for applicable exercises
- Advanced technique refinements

### **Progressive Variables Across Phases:**
1. **Exercise Complexity** - Simple movements → Complex coordinated movements
2. **Intensity Levels** - Light engagement → Maximum engagement
3. **Resistance Application** - No resistance → Added resistance (for applicable exercises)
4. **Movement Control** - Normal pace → Controlled, deliberate movements

---

## **EXERCISE ROTATION & SHUFFLING RULES**

### **Rule 1: No Back-to-Back Identical Days**
- Never repeat the exact same 5-6 exercise combination on consecutive days

### **Rule 2: Primary Exercise Rotation Pattern**
For each target area, rotate primary exercises:
- **Example (Jawline):** Day 1: Chin tucks, Day 3: Jaw resistance, Day 5: Chin tucks + Upward chewing
- Ensure each primary exercise appears at least 2x per week for priority areas

### **Rule 3: Weekly Shuffle Pattern**
- **Monday/Thursday:** Focus on user's weakest area (2 primary exercises from that category)
- **Tuesday/Friday:** Balanced approach (1 exercise per weak area)
- **Wednesday/Saturday:** Secondary focus area emphasized
- **Sunday:** Active recovery (lighter exercises: lymphatic drainage, fish face, sternocleidomastoid stretch)

### **Rule 4: Fatigue Management**
- After high-intensity exercises (Jaw resistance, CPS) appear, next day should include lymphatic drainage
- Maximum 2 consecutive days of jaw-heavy exercises before 1 rest/lighter day
- No more than 3 high-intensity exercises in a single week without a recovery day

### **Rule 5: Intra-Week Variety**
- Each exercise should appear in different positions within the daily sequence
- Example: If "Chin tucks" is exercise #1 on Monday, place it as #3 or #4 when it reappears Thursday

---

## **WEIGHTED INCLUSION BASED ON SCORES**

### **Priority Matrix:**

**For Scores < 50 (Critical):**
- Appearance rate: 5-6 days per week
- 2 exercises from this category per session
- Both primary exercises used in rotation
- Bias toward multi-benefit exercises that include this area

**For Scores 50-65 (Needs Improvement):**
- Appearance rate: 4-5 days per week
- 1-2 exercises from this category per session
- Mix of primary and secondary exercises
- Introduce supporting exercises

**For Scores 65-80 (Moderate):**
- Appearance rate: 3-4 days per week
- 1 exercise from this category per session
- Focus on maintenance and refinement
- Rotate between different exercises for variety

**For Scores > 80 (Strong):**
- Appearance rate: 2-3 days per week
- Maintenance exercises only
- Prevent regression without over-training
- Use as "filler" exercises when daily count needs completion

### **Multi-Benefit Exercise Priority:**
When user has multiple low-scoring areas, prioritize exercises that target multiple areas:
- **Thumb pulling** (#2) - Hits 4 areas (maxilla, jawline, eyes, cheekbones, nose) - Use 4-5x per week
- **Nose-tongue touch** (#14) - Hits 3 areas (cheekbones, jawline, maxilla) - Use 3-4x per week
- **Eyes and cheeks** (#10) - Hits 2 areas - Use 3x per week

**Multi-Area Low Score Bonus Rule:**
- If 3+ areas score < 65: Thumb pulling appears 5x per week minimum
- If 2 areas score < 60: Include one multi-benefit exercise in every session

## **PHASE TRANSITION RULES**

### **Days 1-21 → Days 22-49 Transition:**
- Increase appearance frequency of primary exercises by +1 day per week
- Introduce exercise variations not used in Phase 1
- Begin incorporating more multi-benefit exercises

### **Days 22-49 → Days 50-70 Transition:**
- Maximum frequency for all critical area exercises
- Advanced variations of all exercises
- Strategic pairing of complementary exercises
- Intensified focus on weakest remaining areas

---

## **SPECIAL RULES**

### **Recovery Integration:**
- **Every 7th day:** Replace 2 high-intensity exercises with recovery-focused exercises (lymphatic drainage, fish face, sternocleidomastoid stretch)
- **After milestone days (Day 21, 42, 63):** Full active recovery day (all low-intensity exercises)
- Following any 3 consecutive days with jaw resistance: mandatory lymphatic drainage inclusion

### **Plateau Prevention:**
- Every 14 days, introduce one exercise the user hasn't seen in 7+ days
- Rotate exercise order within the daily set every 3-4 days
- Switch between primary exercises of the same category every 5-7 days

### **Customization Multipliers:**
If user marks specific areas as "priority focus" in app:
- Increase that area's exercises by +1 per session
- Adjust from 5-6 to 6 exercises, with the extra being from priority area
- That area's primary exercises appear 6x per week instead of 4-5x

### **Score Improvement Adaptation:**
- Every 14 days, reassess which areas need priority
- If an area improves from <60 to 60-75: Reduce frequency by 1 day per week
- If an area improves to >75: Switch to maintenance mode
- Redistribute freed exercise slots to remaining weak areas

## **EXERCISE PAIRING SYNERGIES**

### **Complementary Pairs (Work well together in same session):**
- Chin tucks + Hyoid stretch (neck/jaw alignment)
- Chin tucks + Sternocleidomastoid stretch (complete neck/jaw work)
- CPS + Alternating cheek puffs (complete cheekbone work)
- Hunter eyes + Lymphatic drainage (eye area recovery)
- Jaw resistance + Upward chewing (comprehensive jaw development)

### **Avoid Same-Day Combinations:**
- Jaw resistance + Upward chewing + Chin tucks (jaw overload - pick max 2)
- CPS + Alternating cheek puffs + Eyes and cheeks (cheek fatigue - pick max 2)
- Hyoid stretch + Sternocleidomastoid stretch + Neck lift (neck overload - pick max 2)

### **Strategic Sequencing Within Daily Program:**
- Start with high-intensity exercises (when user is fresh)
- Place recovery exercises (lymphatic drainage, sternocleidomastoid stretch) in middle or end
- End with support exercises (hyoid stretch, neck lift)

This framework ensures systematic progression, prevents overtraining, maintains variety, and precisely targets each user's needs based on their assessment scores.
