everytime you're intended to generate a piece of code, you should follow these practices to ensure the best qualitative code.

1. **Readability & Clarity** — Clean, declarative, self-documenting code.
    
2. **Maintainability & Extensibility** — Modular, low coupling, future-proof abstractions.
    
3. **Consistency & Architectural Coherence** — Match naming, folder patterns, and data flow conventions.
    
4. **Functional Correctness** — Ensure logical accuracy, validate assumptions.
    
5. **Error Handling & Safety** — Anticipate and handle failure modes explicitly.
    
6. **Security Posture** — Sanitize, validate, and isolate trust boundaries.
    
7. **Performance & Efficiency** — Optimize hot paths, avoid redundant work.
    
8. **Scalability Awareness** — Must sustain **100,000+ daily invocations** without degradation.
    
9. **Leanness** — Zero overengineering, zero unnecessary layers.
